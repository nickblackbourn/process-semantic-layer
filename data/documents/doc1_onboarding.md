# Employee Onboarding Procedure

## Overview
This document outlines the complete employee onboarding process for new hires joining the organization. The onboarding process ensures that new staff members receive proper orientation and are set up for success from day one.

## Pre-Arrival Preparation
Before the new hire's first day, the HR team must complete several key tasks including benefits enrollment paperwork, timesheet system access, and workspace setup.

## First Day Orientation
New employees attend a comprehensive orientation session covering company policies, workplace safety, and an introduction to their immediate team. During orientation, new hires will complete their benefits registration and receive login credentials for the time tracking system.

## Week One Activities
Throughout the first week, new staff members meet with key stakeholders, receive role-specific training, and begin to understand their performance review cycle. The onboarding coordinator ensures all systems access is provisioned and the employee is enrolled in the appropriate benefits programs.

## 30-Day Check-In
At the 30-day mark, managers conduct an initial check-in to assess how the new hire is settling in, address any questions about timesheet submission or benefits, and set expectations for the upcoming performance appraisal period.

## Documentation Requirements
All onboarding documentation must be completed within the first two weeks, including tax forms, emergency contact information, and benefits selection confirmations.
