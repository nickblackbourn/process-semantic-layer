# Payroll Processing Guidelines

## Purpose
This document establishes standardized procedures for processing employee payroll on a bi-weekly basis, ensuring accurate and timely compensation for all staff members.

## Timesheet Collection
All employees must submit their timesheets by 5 PM on the last day of each pay period. Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving timesheets for their direct reports within 24 hours. The time tracking system automatically flags any missing or incomplete submissions.

## Payroll Calculation
The payroll team processes wage payments based on approved timesheets, accounting for regular hours, overtime, and any applicable deductions. The system automatically calculates tax withholdings based on each employee's W-4 information and current tax regulations.

## Tax Compliance
All payroll processing must comply with federal and state tax filing requirements. The finance team coordinates with external tax consultants to ensure quarterly tax submissions are accurate and timely. Tax reporting is integrated with our financial reporting system for audit purposes.

## Payment Distribution
Salary payments are distributed via direct deposit on the designated pay date. Employees can view their pay stubs and year-to-date compensation information through the employee portal.

## Year-End Processing
At year-end, the payroll team generates W-2 forms for all employees and submits required tax returns to appropriate authorities. This process is closely coordinated with our annual compliance audit to ensure all wage and tax records are accurate.

## Record Retention
All payroll records, including timesheets and tax documentation, must be retained for a minimum of seven years in accordance with regulatory requirements.
