# Vendor Management and Procurement Process

## Overview
This procedure governs how the organization selects, onboards, and manages supplier relationships to ensure quality service delivery and cost-effective procurement.

## Vendor Selection
When a new supplier is needed, the procurement team issues requests for proposals (RFPs) and evaluates vendor capabilities, pricing, and references. All potential vendors must undergo a preliminary compliance check before moving forward.

## Supplier Onboarding
Once a vendor is selected, they must complete our supplier onboarding process which includes contract review, insurance verification, and registration in our vendor management system. The legal team conducts a thorough contract approval process to protect the organization's interests.

## Purchase Authorization
All procurement requests must follow our expense approval workflow. Small purchases under $5,000 require department manager approval, while larger purchases require additional sign-off from finance leadership. This spending approval process ensures proper budget controls.

## Ongoing Vendor Relations
The procurement team maintains regular communication with key suppliers to monitor performance, address issues, and negotiate contract renewals. Vendor performance is reviewed quarterly as part of our expense management practices.

## Contract Management
All vendor contracts are centrally managed with automated renewal reminders. The legal team conducts annual contract reviews to ensure terms remain favorable and compliant with current regulations. Contract documents are stored in our agreement review system for easy access.

## Payment Processing
Vendor invoices are processed through our accounts payable system, which integrates with expense approval workflows to ensure proper authorization before payment. All vendor payments are subject to financial reporting and audit requirements.
