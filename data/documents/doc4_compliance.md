# Annual Compliance Audit Protocol

## Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for conducting the organization's annual compliance audit to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and internal policies.

## Audit Scope
The annual compliance review covers financial reporting, tax filing, payroll processing, expense management, and contract compliance. The audit team examines documentation from the previous fiscal year to verify accuracy and regulatory adherence.

## Preparation Phase
Prior to the audit, all departments must organize their records including financial reports, tax returns, payroll documentation, and vendor contracts. The finance team coordinates with department heads to ensure all materials are readily available for audit review.

## Document Review
Auditors examine financial reporting processes to verify accuracy and completeness. This includes reviewing general ledger entries, expense approvals, and reconciliation procedures. Special attention is paid to tax compliance, ensuring all tax submissions were timely and accurate.

## Payroll and HR Compliance
The audit includes a thorough review of payroll processing procedures, tax withholding calculations, and employee benefits administration. Auditors verify that all wage payments comply with labor laws and that tax filing obligations have been met.

## Vendor and Contract Compliance
Auditors review vendor management practices including contract review procedures, supplier onboarding documentation, and expense approval controls. This ensures that procurement activities follow established policies and that contracts protect organizational interests.

## Findings and Remediation
After completing the audit, auditors prepare a comprehensive report detailing findings and recommendations. Any compliance gaps must be addressed through corrective action plans, with follow-up reviews scheduled as needed.

## Regulatory Reporting
Following the audit, the organization files required compliance reports with regulatory authorities. The audit report is also shared with the board of directors and serves as input for budget planning and policy improvements.
