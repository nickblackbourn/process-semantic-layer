# Financial Reporting and Budget Management

## Overview
This document describes the organization's financial reporting processes and budget planning procedures to ensure transparency, accuracy, and effective resource allocation.

## Monthly Financial Reports
The finance team prepares comprehensive monthly financial reports that summarize revenue, expenses, and budget variances. These accounting reports are distributed to department heads and executive leadership for review and decision-making.

## Expense Management
All organizational spending is tracked through our expense management system, which integrates with the expense approval workflow. Department managers can view real-time spending against their allocated budgets and must justify any significant variances during monthly reviews.

## Budget Planning Cycle
The annual budgeting process begins each fall, with departments submitting budget requests based on strategic priorities and historical spending patterns. The finance team consolidates these requests into a comprehensive budget proposal for executive review.

## Budget Allocation
Once approved, budgets are allocated to departments and loaded into the financial planning system. Throughout the year, budget transfers may be requested through the expense approval process when business needs shift.

## Integration with Other Processes
Financial reporting is closely integrated with payroll processing for personnel cost tracking, vendor management for procurement spending, and compliance audit requirements. This integration ensures consistency across all financial data and simplifies regulatory reporting.

## Expense Approval Controls
All spending must follow the expense approval hierarchy: purchases under $1,000 require supervisor approval, $1,000-$10,000 require department head approval, and amounts over $10,000 require CFO approval. These controls are enforced through our financial systems.

## Quarterly Reviews
Each quarter, the finance team conducts detailed fiscal reporting reviews to assess organizational performance against budget. These reviews inform mid-year budget adjustments and provide early warning of potential funding shortfalls.

## Year-End Close
At fiscal year-end, the finance team completes a comprehensive close process that includes final expense reconciliation, budget variance analysis, and preparation of annual financial statements. These reports are essential inputs for the compliance audit and tax filing processes.
